# Project-Guardian

All of the files here were developed by the LEM Security team and are intended for use with Project Guardian an open source IDS/Firewall designed around portability. 

<p><strong> LEM-Security-Toolkit-v.1 </strong></p>
This script is designed to be used with Project Guardian to be able to make configuration changes as well as administer the device. 

Feel free to download any of the files in this repo or make changes to them to help and improve the project. 

Thank you,
LEM Security Dev. Team
